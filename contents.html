                        <p>Midwest emo is a genre that historically utilizes a variety of odd and sometimes unwieldy tunings. While learning how to play emo guitar, I’ve sometimes been discouraged by the expectation that I retune my instrument whenever I want to learn a new song. Luckily, there are a myriad of tracks that are able sidestep this issue, achieving unique sound palettes within the confines of standard tuning. In learning these sorts of tracks I’ve acquired tools that augment my own playing and writing style. In this article, I’m going to be analyzing some riffs that I think are benchmarks for playing midwest emo in standard tuning.

<h3>Cap’n Jazz - Puddle Splashers:</h3>
<p>Despite pioneering the classic twinkly midwest emo sound, a surprising amount of Cap’n Jazz’s repertoire is in E Standard. The band relies on jangly, off-kilter leads and high gain rhythm guitars to build a unique sonic picture.
<br>
In the intro to Puddle Splashers, the guitar’s rhythm is initially hard to pin down. The main factor that gives the riff its distinct mathy feel is its shifting time. The arpeggio dances around an open Major 7th shape, dropping an eighth note every other measure for a 7/8 feel. 
<br>
What makes it work especially well as an emo song is the way the soft arpeggio breaks into a distorted guitar that hammers in the root before propelling into the song's verse. A light lead guitar line offers a response to the crunchy hits on the downbeat. While the parts aren’t incredibly complex on their own, they work around each other to collectively form a dynamic build-up. Cap’n Jazz illustrates how techniques like odd meter and instrumental dynamics can give your playing an emo quality.

<h3>Home Is Where - Yes! Yes! A Thousand Times Yes!</h3>
<p>Fifth wave emo band Home Is Where provides an energetic blend of traditional midwest emo, post hardcore, and more folky sounds. They draw a lot of stylistic inspiration from second wave bands (including Cap’n Jazz) and have produced a host of creative guitar parts in their relatively short career. 
<br>
This track from their sophomore LP The Whaler highlights a tendency of many emo songs in standard – droning. While the main riff is played high up on the neck of the guitar, open strings are allowed to ring out, filling in the gaps between accents. This has an effect similar to that of an open tuning – allowing the guitarist to play intervals that would be difficult in standard chord voicings. In Yes! Yes! A Thousand Times Yes!, the consistent barrage of straight eighth notes gives the song a driving groove. Building harmonies using open strings that are consonant with the notes you are playing can bring a lot of fullness to your sound.

<h3>Merchant Ships - Sleep Patterns</h3>
<p>
Merchant Ships is an emo revival act that normally occupies an energetic screamo realm. Their music also falls into clean and twinkly midwest emo territory. What makes them special is how they consolidate these aspects into an anthemic sound. 
<br>
Sleep patterns is a break from their usual rapid structure as a slow acoustic number. It showcases the power of simplicity amidst complicated dynamics. The song relies heavily on the power of the capo. With a first fret barre, it manages to sound brighter and slightly off center from standard tuning. It doesn’t stray much from open chords in one position but uses subtleties in arpeggio and interval to evoke a sense of longing.  The chord progression descends from the vi to the V to the IV of G# Major, with an odd bar count that leads to it never resolving. The emotional journey that this song takes the listener on showcases how much complexity can be accomplished with simple and vulnerable songwriting.

<h3>The Brave Little Abacus - I See It Too</h3>
<p>
M	The Brave Little Abacus is one of my favorite emo groups, and undeniably one of the most influential on modern emo music. In addition to covering tons of musical ground in his writing, frontman Adam Demirjian is very proficient as a guitarist. His fast and intricate playing is a key component in the band’s wild sound. 
<br>
      I See It Too is a ten minute journey of a song that takes the listener through a variety of musical states. The first four of those minutes are spent droning on a C Major shape, which is slid up a step for an open Major 11 sound. The guitar being strummed with only upstrokes gives it a dreamy harp-like quality. Finally, the build-up reaches its peak with the guitar hanging on the final chord. 
<br>
This tension is released as a sweeping arpeggio comes in, totally shifting the song’s tone. The riff lands on a G major, the song’s tonic, for the first time. In contrast to the descending pull of the prior section, this one relies on upward motion, hitting the major second for a suspended sound before descending back to the root and the song’s B section. Brave Little Abacus guitar parts are a good example of meshing together different positions and playing styles for a cohesive whole. I See It Too works in standard because it leans into building tension toward an ultimate payoff, utilizing technical shifts to dictate the song’s tone.
