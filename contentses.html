                                This song was originally titled boom.als but I decided to give it a real title for the ep. I wanted to write a bridge but I never really figured anything out so I decided to just keep it short and sweet. I was listening to a lot of hyperpop music when I made the track, which is the inspo behind the vocal processing and sfz horns. I’m still pretty proud of the groove I came up with and the countermelodies between the horns, vox, and other instrumentation.

                                I’m still working on this one and it might be part of a future release. The instrumentation started out as a whole different vibe but the lyrics have stuck. I think they’re just the right amount of abstract. I’m going for a pretty minimalist thing here, though I’m thinking of expanding the outro into something a bit more rewarding. I played this one <a href="Yield to Horse - live at the Undergarden 4_12.mov">with my band</a> recently.

                                This song is pretty weird but it also feels pretty special. The guitar is in an EADGBg tuning so that I could hit the octave of each chord’s third, giving it a pretty, open sound. I was experimenting with some unconventional recording techniques, and I ended up recording my acoustic guitar through some earbuds draped over the sound hole. This is what gives it that fuzzed out but still recognizably organic tone. None of the vocals in this song are really spot on, but I think that adds to the warbly underwater vibe. One of my favorite layers is the synth that comes in during the second verse, which is actually my voice stacked and resampled in the ableton simpler.

                                ok bye.
